# batterystats
This script was initially written a few years ago to find the remaining battery capacity of 1 or 2 batteries installed in Windows 7 laptops. I designed it to allow the data to be output a few different ways depending on how data needed to be gathered from the laptops for analysis.

I've gained a fair bit of scripting knowledge since this was written so I'll probably rewrite/simplify it a bit in the future, but figured I would share what I have now.
